Files and code to study the cost and frequency of cyber breaches

I am interested in applying Extreme Value Theory to this problem.

Several months ago, I was reading about the problem of Predicting Earthquakes in Nate Silver's book, The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail - But Some Don't 

When I began to study the problem of predicting the cost and frequency of cyber breaches, 
my insight was that Cyber breaches are a lot like earthquakes. Interestingly enough, when I thought of applying the richter 
scale to cyber breaches, someone already beat me to it: http://breachlevelindex.com/#!breach-database ...

With earthquakes, we know the "hot zones" and have enough data to say earthquakes will occur at some frequency, but we 
will not be able to predict when the next one will occur and the magnitude of it. 

Now I want to think like an insurance company -- how would I develop a plan to sell insurance and make a profit?
